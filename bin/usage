PIPING
     You can pass in all the properties using the arguments but you 
     can also pipe-in a json object that contains some of the
     arguments to add arguments.

     To pipe-in data you have to add the --pipe property.

     Example:
          echo "{\"user\":\"me\"}" | emailjs --pipe

ATTACHMENTS
     You can also send attachments through the API. Since the 
     definition is quite complex you can only do that using the pipe-mode.

          {
               "attachment": [ ... list of attachments ... ]
          }

     One attachment is an object that has one of the following
     fields:

          path
               string to where the file is located
          data
               string of the data you want to attach

     And can additionally have:

          type
               string of the file mime type

          name 
               name to give the file as perceived by the recipient

          charset
               charset to encode attachment in

          method 
               method to send attachment as
               (used by calendar invites)

          alternative
               if true, will be attached inline as an alternative
               (also defaults type='text/html')

          inline
               if true, will be attached inline

          encoded
               set this to true if the data is already base64
               encoded, (avoid this if possible)

          headers
               object containing header=>value pairs for inclusion
               in this attachment's header

          related
               an array of attachments that you want to be related
               to the parent attachment
